        <h1>Digital Archives Workflow Controller (DAWC)</h1>

<p>A flexible platform for orchestrating digital preservation workflows.  Workflows are defined specific to particular migration projects. These workflows are submitted to the DAWC in a custom XML format along with digital records. The workflow tool then calls the different applications and web services as defined in that XML file. The workflow tool has both command line and web service interfaces. </p>
